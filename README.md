# Financial Tracker

## Description of the Project

In this project, the goal is to create functioning financial tracker that is able to add to a ledger, and track each change as
it happens. The changes are then written and saved to a corresponding exel file. The program can also display the history
of each action. The user can filter the actions for more convenient use. Overall the project is meant to provide an interface with 
a variety of options and situations.
